                    <p>
                        the story begins in 2008 in a garage the hague where two people named hasan tasdemir and pascal rappailes
                        but their garage quickly became to short so they moved to a warehouse but in the winter their equipment became to cold there
                        so they then had to quickly move al their stuff to the vacant ministry of agriculture when also that place had to be emptied out 
                        they shortly moved to an old showroom for classical cars but when they weren't able to renovate their machines they searched again 
                        for one last time and when they found a place in 2011 next to cobalstraat in zoetermeer where it currently recides
